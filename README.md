# AOXCDAO | Autonomous Operations & Cross-Chain DAO

## 🏗️ Status: Phase II - Architectural Construction
**AOXCDAO** is a high-fidelity decentralized autonomous organization protocol, purpose-built for the **X LAYER (OKX)** ecosystem. We are currently in the active construction phase, synthesizing a hybrid governance framework that bridges sovereign AI intelligence with human council oversight.

---

## 🛰️ X LAYER Infrastructure Layer
This protocol leverages the **ZK-EVM** efficiency of **X LAYER** to ensure mathematical proof-based security and ultra-low latency execution. Our infrastructure is optimized for:
* **Scalable Governance:** Utilizing X LAYER's high-throughput environment for real-time telemetry.
* **Security Provenance:** Inheriting Ethereum’s security layer through ZK-rollups for immutable protocol mühür (sealing).
* **Interoperable Intelligence:** Designed to serve as a gateway for cross-chain AI agent interactions.

---

## 🏛️ System Framework
The repository is structured according to the **Universal Academic Indexing (00-40)** standard, ensuring rigorous traceability across all protocol sectors:

* **CORE ADAPTATION:** High-performance smart contract logic optimized for X LAYER gas efficiency.
* **SPECIFICATION:** The evolving digital constitution and threat modeling.
* **INFRASTRUCTURE:** Dedicated deployment suites and sentinel monitoring engines.
* **TELEMETRY:** Forensic logging and real-time state tracking for on-chain operations.

## 🧪 Development Notice
The system is currently under active development. Access to certain sectors is restricted until the **Supreme Sealing** ceremony.

> **Academic Note:** AOXCDAO maintains a strict "Code as Constitution" policy. All architectural decisions are indexed and recorded via the **OX-SERIAL** protocol for forensic auditing.
