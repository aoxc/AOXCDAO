## 🚨 Institutional Advisory
> **Current Status:** Under Architectural Hardening (Level 1)

* ❌ **Production Ready:** No (Experimental Baseline)
* 🏗️ **Phase:** Level 1 – Structural Construction & Forensic Anchoring
* 🧪 **Verification:** In-progress (Unit & Invariant stress tests pending)
* 🔒 **Security Audit:** Internal audit active | External audit scheduled
* ⚠️ **Risk Vector:** High-entropy development environment (User discretion advised)

---

## 🌟 Strategic Vision
✨ **AOXCDAO V2 – Akdeniz** is a next-generation modular framework designed for institutional asset orchestration. It transcends traditional DAO limits by integrating regulatory compliance and forensic observability directly into the smart contract execution layer.

* ⚖️ **Compliance Embedded:** Jurisdictional alignment enforced at the bytecode level.
* 📡 **Forensic Transparency:** Real-time telemetry providing full state visibility.
* 🏛️ **Governance by Merit:** Reputation-weighted consensus mechanisms for resilient decision-making.

## 🏗️ Development Roadmap (V2 Fleet)
> *“Foundations are being placed with mathematical precision. The shipyard is active, but the fleet remains in assembly.”*

| 🔨 Milestone | 🎯 Technical Focus | 📊 Current Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | Core architecture & EIP-1967 Schematics | 🏗️ **In Progress** |
| **Level 2** | Sentinel Intelligence & Analytics Integration | 📅 Planned |
| **Level 3** | Network Activation & Sovereign Deployment | 🚀 Planned |

📝 Operational Notes
🏗️ Construction Phase: All interfaces subject to refinement based on formal verification results.

⛔ Legacy Policy: Zero compatibility with deprecated V1 non-structured patterns.

🛠️ Core Tooling: Foundry + Orchestrator V1.1.0 | Solidity 0.8.33 Baseline.
