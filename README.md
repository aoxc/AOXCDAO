## 🌟 The Vision: Community-Led Institutional Excellence
**AOXC v2 Prime – Akdeniz** is a second-generation, institutional-grade token architecture. It is designed not just as a piece of code, but as a **living ecosystem** where institutional rigor meets decentralized community governance (DAO). 

This protocol is built on three core pillars:
* **Compliant by Design:** Regulatory alignment integrated at the bytecode level.
* **Observable by Default:** Real-time telemetry and forensic transparency.
* **Governed by Merit:** Sophisticated governance models driven by contribution and stake.
