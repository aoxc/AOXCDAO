# ⚓ AOXC Sovereign Fleet | Type Definitions (DNA Layer)

This directory serves as the **Central Nervous System** for the AOXC DAO. It contains the TypeScript type definitions and interfaces required to maintain the structural integrity, legal compliance, and autonomous logic of the 7-Capital Ship fleet.

## 🧬 Core Architecture

The type system is categorized into four primary operational domains:

### 1. Fleet Dynamics & Hierarchy
* **`vessel_dynamics.ts` & `hierarchy.ts`**: Defines the 5-layer sovereign structure (Governance to Passenger).
* **`karujan_authority.ts`**: The root authority types governing the fleet's "Source of Truth."

### 2. Autonomous Intelligence & Security
* **`ai_neural_sync.ts`**: Interfaces for smart contract and AI model synchronization.
* **`forensic.ts` & `justice_protocol.ts`**: Post-incident analysis and decentralized judicial enforcement types.
* **`autonomous_repair.ts`**: Logic for self-healing infrastructure.

### 3. Economic & Interoperability
* **`xlayer_bridge.ts`**: Native OKX XLayer (ZK-Rollup) integration types.
* **`diplomacy_trade.ts`**: Peer-to-peer fleet commerce and diplomatic exchange protocols.

### 4. Lifecycle & Registry
* **`lifecycle.ts`**: State machine definitions for contract evolution.
* **`visa.ts`**: Credential-based access control for cross-ship movements.

## 🛠 Usage

These types are consumed by the **Fleet Manager (.ts)** scripts to ensure that every serialized contract (`00001.SHIP...`) adheres to the strict architectural standards of the AOXC ecosystem.
