# AOXCDAO V2: THE SOVEREIGN PROTOCOL (AKDENIZ)
## Technical Specification and Meritocratic Framework for Galactic Governance
**Version:** 1.1.2-ALPHA  
**Security Status:** SEALED (0-BYTE TSC STRUCTURAL SILENCE)  
**Classification:** ARCH-PRO ULTIMATE ACADEMIC

## I. ABSTRACT
AOXCDAO V2 (Codename: *Akdeniz*) introduces a holistic **Sovereign Operating System (SOS)** designed to manage a decentralized civilization of one billion entities. The protocol synthesizes high-fidelity biometric data, autonomous logistics, and a deflationary economic engine. By enforcing a **Zero-Tolerance Quality Standard (ZTQS)**, the system achieves absolute structural integrity, verified by a null-output (0-byte) compiler audit.

## II. SYSTEMIC ARCHITECTURE & MULTI-LAYERED LOGIC

### 1. Biometric Stratification & Genetic Class (GC)
The foundational identity layer (`bio01`) utilizes **Deterministic DNA Hashing (DDH)** to prevent Sybil attacks and ensure long-term genealogical tracking.
* **Genetic Hierarchy:** Identities are categorized into four distinct strata: `ALPHA`, `BETA`, `GAMMA`, and `DELTA`.
* **Reputation Quotient ($R_q$):** A dynamic, meritocratic variable ($0 \le R_q \le 10,000$) derived from systemic contributions.
* **Identity Integrity:** Every citizen object is strictly typed to prevent data leakage during cross-module synchronization.

### 2. The Vessel Logistics Engine (`sys02`)
The fleet operates on a **Segmented Node Model**, where each vessel acts as an autonomous execution environment.
* **Encapsulation:** Vessels maintain local state isolation, interacting with the Global Registry only for critical synchronization.
* **Linguistic Enforcement:** Entry into strategic vessel nodes requires a pre-validated `GeneticClass` multiplier.

### 3. Deflationary Macroeconomics & Treasury (`sys03`)
The **AOXC Credit** system is governed by a high-precision arithmetic engine (18-decimal fixed-point).
* **The Burn Protocol:** A systemic 1% deflationary tax is applied to all inter-node resource transactions, ensuring scarcity.
* **Algorithmic Stipends:** Compensation is calculated through the formula:
  $$Salary = (BaseRank \times R_q) \cdot \Phi$$
  *(Where $\Phi$ represents the current Imperial Resource Index).*

## III. MERITOCRATIC GOVERNANCE & SOVEREIGN CONSENSUS (`sys04`)
Governance rejects traditional binary democracy in favor of **Weighted Sovereign Consensus (WSC)**.

### 1. Voting Power (VP) Calculation
The influence of a citizen within the legislative chamber is mathematically weighted:
$$VP = \left( BaseClassMultiplier + \frac{R_q}{100} \right) \times 10^{18}$$

### 2. Legislative Safeguards
* **Authority Barrier:** Only `ALPHA` class citizens with $R_q > 8,000$ possess the authority to initiate an *Imperial Decree* (Proposal).
* **Automated Rejection:** Proposals from unauthorized or low-reputation nodes are terminated at the kernel level before reaching the consensus layer.

## IV. CYBERNETIC DEFENSE & RECOVERY (PLAN C)
The **Sovereign Quarantine Protocol** (`sec01`) ensures system survivability during a catastrophic security breach.

1. **Modular Necrosis:** Upon detection of an anomaly (e.g., unauthorized access or DNA mismatch), the infected node is instantly decoupled.
2. **Resource Blockage:** The compromised vessel's connection to the Treasury is severed, freezing all localized assets.
3. **The Phoenix Protocol:** Automated state restoration to the last verified **0-byte TSC snapshot**, ensuring a clean-slate recovery without logical remnants of the breach.

## V. TECHNICAL INTEGRITY & COMPILER AUDIT
The code base is subject to the **TSC Structural Silence** mandate. Every deployment cycle requires a null-output log to verify:
* **Null Dead Code:** Absolute elimination of unused variables (TS6133).
* **Arithmetic Safety:** Zero tolerance for precision loss in BigInt operations.
* **Consensus Sync:** 100% type alignment between `sys00` through `sys04`.
